# NEOSidekick.MarkdownForAgents

**Markdown rendering for AI agents for the Neos CMS.**

The package makes Neos pages available as clean Markdown while keeping the normal
HTML experience unchanged for browsers. Agents can request Markdown either via a
`.md` URL suffix or through HTTP content negotiation. The package converts most of
your content correctly out of the box; add a dedicated renderer only where the
result needs improvement.

## Why Markdown

AI agents usually do not need navigation menus, footers, scripts, cookie banners,
or layout markup. They need the canonical page content in a format that is easy
to parse, quote, summarize, and reason about.

This package provides that agent-facing representation while reusing normal Neos
rendering whenever no dedicated Markdown Fusion prototype exists.

Content that cannot be expressed inline is turned into a link the agent can
follow rather than being dropped: an `<iframe>` becomes a link to its `src`
(labelled with its `title`), and a `<form>` becomes a link to the page that hosts
it — so an agent can still route a user to your contact form. These link labels
are translatable via `Resources/Private/Translations/<locale>/Markdown.xlf`.

## Installation

Require the package in the site package or project:

```bash
composer require neosidekick/markdown-for-agents
```

Then make sure Neos package discovery and caches are refreshed.

```bash
./flow flow:package:rescan
./flow flow:cache:flush
```

### Ask your AI agent of choice to implement the Fusion components

````
SITE BASE URL: https://example.com
SITEMAP: <base>/sitemap.xml

# 1. Verify basic functionality

Fetch the homepage as Markdown and as HTML and compare:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" <base>/
curl <base>/
```

The Markdown response must send `Content-Type: text/markdown` and `Vary: Accept`,
and the body must contain the primary content without header, navigation, footer,
scripts, cookie banners, or explicitly skipped chrome.

# 2. Triage every page type from the sitemap

For each document type, fetch one page as `text/markdown` and `text/html` and
compare. A dedicated `.Markdown` renderer is the EXCEPTION, not the default — most
pages convert well via the fallback. Only intervene where the Markdown is poor.
You can delegate page types to sub-agents.

Look specifically for: empty-alt image noise `![](…)`, tables collapsed into one
line, duplicated link text, and JS-only state messages ("no results for the
selected filters"). Keep screen-reader-only (`.sr-only`) text — it is often the
best label for an agent; drop only pure control noise (e.g. slider scroll buttons)
by marking that specific control with `data-markdown-skip`.

Forms: the package turns every kept `<form>` into a link to its page (a contact
CTA for agents). Classify each one — keep real contact/lead forms, but flag
**technical** forms that are page mechanics rather than content (site search,
result filters, language/region switchers, login, newsletter sign-up) to be hidden.

# 3. Fix, preferring the least invasive option (in this order)

1. Mark non-content and interactive elements with `data-markdown-skip` — filters,
   sliders, carousels, and the technical forms you flagged above.
2. Add or adjust `removeSelectors` in the package settings for cross-cutting noise.
3. Let listing/overview pages paginate normally — the pagination renders as
   Markdown links agents can follow page by page (see the Flowpack.Listable recipe).
4. Only add a dedicated `{Type}.Markdown` prototype when the content hierarchy
   genuinely needs it (articles, structured pages). See this README for the pattern
   and for recipes such as the Flowpack.Listable pagination override.

Never change the HTML/visitor output — make Markdown-only adjustments.

# 4. Test suite

If the site package has a test suite, add a few basic tests to verify the above.

## Robots.txt Content Signals

The package extends `Neos.Seo:RobotsTxt` with content signals for agents:

```text
Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes
```

The values are configured on the `Neos.Neos:Site` node through the added
inspector group **Agents Content Signals** in the SEO tab:

- Allow AI Training
- Allow Search
- Allow AI Input

Each option is stored as a boolean and defaults to enabled. Disabled options are
rendered as `no` in the generated `Content-Signal` directive.

If you cannot see these fields on the homepage node, make sure your homepage
node type includes `Neos.Neos:Site` as a supertype:

```yaml
'Vendor.Site:Document.HomePage':
  superTypes:
    'Neos.Neos:Site': true
```

## Testing

Useful checks after installation:

```bash
curl -I -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://example.com/
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://example.com/
curl https://example.com/some/page.md
```

The first response should include `Content-Type: text/markdown` and `Vary:
Accept`. The body should contain the primary page content without global header,
navigation, footer, scripts, cookie banners, or explicitly skipped site chrome.

## Package Architecture

### Requesting Markdown

There are two supported entry points.

#### URL suffix

Every Neos frontend node can be requested with the `.md` suffix:

```bash
curl https://example.com/company/about-us.md
```

The package registers a route for `{node}.md` and maps it to the Neos frontend
node controller with the `markdown` format.

The site root (homepage) has an empty URI path segment, so its Markdown URL is
`/index.md` rather than `/.md` — the latter is a dotfile-like path that common
web servers reject. A dedicated `{node}index.md` route that only matches the site
node serves that direct request:

```bash
curl https://example.com/index.md
```

#### Accept header

Agents can also request the regular URL and express that they prefer Markdown:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://example.com/company/about-us
```

The content negotiation middleware switches eligible Neos frontend node requests
from `html` to `markdown` when `text/markdown` is preferred over `text/html`.
`text/plain` is also accepted as an agent fallback. Browser-style requests keep
rendering HTML.

Examples:

```bash
# Markdown wins
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown,text/html;q=0.1" https://example.com/page

# HTML wins
curl -H "Accept: text/html,text/markdown" https://example.com/page
```

Markdown responses use:

```http
Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8
Vary: Accept
```

### Linking HTML and Markdown

Every page cross-references its two representations through HTTP `Link` headers,
so agents and crawlers can discover the Markdown variant without parsing the HTML
body.

The **HTML** response advertises its Markdown variant as an alternate:

```http
Link: <https://example.com/company/about-us.md>; rel="alternate"; type="text/markdown"
```

The **Markdown** response points back to the canonical HTML page:

```http
Link: <https://example.com/company/about-us>; rel="canonical"
```

Internal links inside the Markdown body resolve to the canonical HTML page, not the
`.md` variant — the same target as the `rel="canonical"` header above. An agent that
wants a linked page as Markdown requests it like any other page, via the Accept
header or the `.md` suffix.

### Rendering Flow

1. A request reaches Neos as format `markdown`.
2. `Root.fusion` selects `NEOSidekick.MarkdownForAgents:DocumentResponse`.
3. The response delegates the body to `NEOSidekick.MarkdownForAgents:MarkdownRenderer`.
4. The renderer looks at the current document node type.
5. It first tries to render a dedicated Fusion prototype with the same type name
   and the `.Markdown` suffix.
6. If no dedicated prototype exists, it renders the normal HTML prototype and
   converts the result to Markdown.

For a document type named:

```text
Example.Site:Document.BlogPost
```

the renderer looks for:

```text
Example.Site:Document.BlogPost.Markdown
```

The `.Markdown` suffix follows Neos Fusion prototype naming conventions and keeps
Markdown renderers next to the document prototypes they specialize.

### Dedicated Markdown Prototypes

Dedicated Markdown prototypes should be used for important content types such as
blog posts, press releases, documentation pages, product pages, and landing pages
where the generic HTML fallback cannot know the intended content hierarchy.

Example:

```fusion
prototype(Vendor.Site:Document.Article.Markdown) < prototype(Neos.Fusion:Component) {
    @context.documentNode = ${node}

    title = ${q(documentNode).property('title')}
    canonicalUri = Neos.Neos:NodeUri {
        node = ${documentNode}
        absolute = true
        format = 'html'
    }
    intro = ${q(documentNode).property('intro')}
    content = Neos.Neos:ContentCollection {
        nodePath = 'main'
    }

    renderer = afx`
# {props.title}

Source: {props.canonicalUri}

{NEOSidekickMarkdown.htmlToMarkdown(props.intro)}

{NEOSidekickMarkdown.htmlToMarkdown(props.content)}
    `
}
```

Recommended structure for dedicated Markdown output:

- Start with one `#` heading matching the page title.
- Include the canonical HTML URL near the top.
- Render only the primary content, not global page chrome.
- Preserve useful metadata such as date, author, category, or source.
- Use meaningful image alt text.
- Internal links are resolved to the canonical HTML page automatically; no manual
  rewriting is needed.

### HTML Fallback

When no `.Markdown` prototype exists, the renderer falls back to the normal HTML
Fusion prototype and converts that HTML with `league/html-to-markdown`. During
conversion the package also turns HTML tables into Markdown tables. `iframe` and
`form` elements are rewritten as followable links rather than stripped (see above).

Before conversion, `HtmlContentSimplifier` removes generic page chrome. The
selectors are configured through package settings as `selector => true` maps, so a
downstream project can add its own selectors or disable a default by overriding its
value to `false`. `navigationSelectors` is a separate map that is only applied when
`removeNavigation` is enabled (the default):

```yaml
NEOSidekick:
  MarkdownForAgents:
    htmlContentSimplifier:
      navigationSelectors:
        'nav': true
        '[role*="navigation"]': true
        '.navigation': true
        '.navi': true
        '.navbox': true
      removeSelectors:
        'header': true
        'footer': true
        'head': true
        '.head': true
        '.header': true
        '.footer': true
        '.cookie-dialog': true
        'svg': true
        'source': true
        # iframe and form are deliberately absent: HtmlContentSimplifier turns them
        # into links. Use data-markdown-skip to drop individual ones.
        'script': true
        'style': true
        '[aria-hidden="true"]': true
        '[data-sidekick-skip]': true
        '[data-neosidekick-skip]': true
        '[data-markdown-skip]': true
```

For example, a site package adds its own selectors and disables one default like so:

```yaml
NEOSidekick:
  MarkdownForAgents:
    htmlContentSimplifier:
      removeSelectors:
        '.sr-only': true
        'footer': false
```

Site packages can also explicitly mark non-content chrome with `data-markdown-skip`
when it should be omitted from Markdown, so no extra Fusion component is needed.

Example:

```fusion
renderer = afx`
    <main>
        <article>
            {props.content}
        </article>
        <aside class="sidebar" data-markdown-skip>
            {props.shareLinks}
            {props.latestArticles}
            {props.contactBox}
        </aside>
    </main>
`
```

#### Per-request overrides with `htmlContentSimplifier`

`NEOSidekick.MarkdownForAgents:MarkdownRenderer` exposes a dedicated
`htmlContentSimplifier` option for runtime overrides. This is merged with the
package defaults, so you can override only individual entries instead of
replacing the whole configuration.

Common use case: pick slightly different Markdown output for different agent
profiles (for example, researcher vs. shopping assistant) while keeping one
shared baseline in `Settings.yaml`.

```fusion
prototype(Vendor.Site:Document.Page.Markdown) < prototype(Neos.Fusion:Component) {
    agentProfile = ${request.httpRequest.getHeaderLine('X-Agent-Profile')}

    renderer = NEOSidekick.MarkdownForAgents:MarkdownRenderer {
        type = 'Vendor.Site:Document.Page'
        canonicalUri = Neos.Neos:NodeUri {
            node = ${documentNode}
            absolute = true
            format = 'html'
        }

        htmlContentSimplifier = Neos.Fusion:DataStructure {
            removeSelectors = Neos.Fusion:DataStructure {
                # disable one default selector for one profile
                'footer' = ${props.agentProfile == 'research' ? false : true}

                # add an extra selector only for one profile
                '.pricing-widget' = ${props.agentProfile == 'shopping'}
            }

            # override scalar options per profile as well
            removeLinks = ${props.agentProfile == 'extract'}
        }
    }
}
```

Notes:

- `removeSelectors` entries are merged key-by-key; set a known selector to
  `false` to disable that default, or add a new selector with `true`.
- `navigationSelectors` currently come from package settings; use
  `removeNavigation` as the runtime toggle.
- This only affects Markdown rendering and does not change HTML output.

### Eel Helper

The package exposes the helper as `NEOSidekickMarkdown`.

```fusion
markdown = ${NEOSidekickMarkdown.htmlToMarkdown(q(node).property('text'))}
```

The helper accepts the same options as the converter:

```fusion
markdown = ${NEOSidekickMarkdown.htmlToMarkdown(value, {
    removeNavigation: true,
    removeLinks: false,
    keepEmptyAltImages: true
})}
```

Available options. Each one defaults to the matching `htmlContentSimplifier.*`
package setting; passing it here deliberately overrides that fallback for the
single conversion:

- `removeNavigation`: also removes the configured `navigationSelectors` before
  conversion. Defaults to `true` (configurable via
  `htmlContentSimplifier.removeNavigation`).
- `removeLinks`: removes `href` attributes before conversion. Defaults to `false`
  (configurable via `htmlContentSimplifier.removeLinks`).
- `keepEmptyAltImages`: keeps images that have no `alt` text. Defaults to `true`
  (configurable via `htmlContentSimplifier.keepEmptyAltImages`); set it to `false`
  to drop such images as decorative noise. Agents can still fetch and analyse a
  kept image, which is why keeping them is the default.

### Working with community packages

Third-party rendering packages occasionally produce output that is fine for
browsers but wrong for agents. Solve this with a small Fusion override that is
gated on `request.format == 'markdown'`, so the HTML representation stays
untouched.

#### Full lists instead of pagination (Flowpack.Listable)

Agents consume the whole document at once, so a paginated listing must render
every item — otherwise an agent only ever sees the first page. Lift the page size
for the Markdown format by overriding `Flowpack.Listable:PaginatedCollection`:

```fusion
prototype(Flowpack.Listable:PaginatedCollection) {
    itemsPerPage.@process.renderAllForMarkdown = ${request.format == 'markdown' ? 100000 : value}
}
```

Every overview that builds on `PaginatedCollection` inherits this, so a single
override makes all listing pages complete for agents while browsers keep their
pagination. The same `request.format == 'markdown'` gate works for other
community prototypes — e.g. forcing `absolute` URIs or hiding interactive widgets.

### Error Handling

Markdown rendering should never expose a Neos exception page as Markdown.

If an explicit `.Markdown` prototype throws an exception, the renderer logs the
failure and falls back to converted HTML when `fallbackToHtml` is enabled.

If HTML fallback rendering fails, or if the fallback output looks like a Neos
exception page, the package returns a small Markdown error document containing
the page title and canonical URL instead of leaking the HTML error output.

### Test Suite

The package ships unit tests that run inside a Neos distribution, the same way
the GitHub Actions pipeline runs them. From the distribution root:

```bash
bin/phpunit -c DistributionPackages/NEOSidekick.MarkdownForAgents/Tests/UnitTests.xml
```

The workflow additionally runs PSR-12 code style (`phpcs`) and PHPStan static
analysis across the supported PHP and Neos versions.

## Open Questions

### Absolute asset URIs

Node and inline link URIs are made absolute and resolved as canonical HTML under
the `markdown` format (via a `Neos.Neos:NodeUri` override and a
`Neos.Neos:ConvertUris` subclass), but **asset URIs are not** made absolute. `LinkingService::resolveAssetUri()` has no `absolute` flag and simply
returns whatever the resource publishing target yields (host-relative by
default), and projects often re-route assets through their own controller, so
there is no single place the package can hook. Deciding where and how to force
absolute asset URIs for agents — package default vs. per-project resource/target
configuration — is still open.
